##'DATA-COMPRESSION-TOOL', involves developing a program that reduces the size of digital data while preserving its essential information, making it more efficient for storage and transmission. This project will require you to understand and implement fundamental data compression algorithms, broadly categorized into lossless and lossy techniques. Lossless algorithms, such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman Coding, or Lempel-Ziv  algorithms , are crucial as they allow for the perfect reconstruction of the original data, making them suitable for text, executables, and medical images. Lossy algorithms, on the other hand, achieve higher compression ratios by discarding some less critical information, commonly used for multimedia files like images  and audio, where some fidelity loss is acceptable for significant size reduction. You will need to implement the core logic for at least one chosen algorithm, including the encoding and decoding processes, and critically analyze its efficiency in terms of compression ratio and processing speed. For guidance and understanding, GEMINI AI can offer in-depth explanations of various algorithms, pseudo-code, and help in debugging logic. YouTube channels often provide visual explanations and practical coding examples of compression techniques, simplifying complex concepts. Your web browser, Chrome, will be vital for researching academic papers, articles, and specialized programming tutorials on data compression, offering diverse perspectives and detailed algorithmic breakdowns. Lastly, VS Code Studio will be your development environment, providing the necessary tools to write, test, and profile your C code for the data compression tool, allowing you to build and refine the encoding and decoding functions efficiently.
